catterfly is a unique framework that imitates the life cycle of a butterfly to understand and respond to user input. From a caterpillar's initial exploration to the butterfly's final lifecycle, this program offers a metaphorical representation of learning, growth, and evolution. It is represented as three states:

## Caterpillar Phase:

Biological: The caterpillar consumes and learns about its environment, growing and preparing for its transformation.

catterfly: The Caterpillar class makes decisions based on user input and constructs a path based on this input. This phase is about consuming information and setting the foundation.

## Cocoon Phase:

Biological: In the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes complete liquification and transformation. Many structures of the caterpillar are broken down into their basic components and are reconstructed to form the new structures of the butterfly.

catterfly: The Cocoon class takes the decisions (path) from the Caterpillar phase and constructs a 'personality' (akin to the new structures of the butterfly). This is a transformational phase where the input is distilled into a new context or perspective.

## Butterfly Phase:

Biological: The butterfly emerges with a completely different form, with wings and other structures that allow it to interact with its environment in entirely new ways. It now perceives and interacts with the world differently than when it was a caterpillar.

catterfly: The Butterfly class, informed by the constructed 'personality', interacts with the user in a dynamic manner. It has a 'memory' of past interactions (last response) and interacts based on that and the user's input, offering a new dimensional context. The idea of a caterpillar's mind being "dissolved" before being reconstructed is analogous to the process of taking user input, abstracting and breaking it down, and then reformulating it with a new "personality" or context. It also has basic tool use being able to search wikipedia and add the result into chat context. 

In both the biological phenomenon and with catterfly, there's a theme of transformation and renewal â€” the idea that something can be broken down to its core components and then rebuilt into something new and different, with the capacity for new types of interactions.
